# Rock Paper Scissors game
This is a beginner Python project where I built a simple Rock Paper Scissors game to practice programming basics.

Purpose
This rock-paper-scissors program was made to experiment ad test Python basic programming concepts.

What I learned
I learned how to use basic concepts such as loops, if, elif, else, and inputs/outputs. It helped me understand how basic Python works and gave me a hand to start diving deep into it 

How to run it
To run the project you will need to install Python, and run the file in your terminal or IDE
